## 🚀 How to Use Agents

### Method 1: Natural Language (Recommended)
Just describe what you need in natural language. Claude Code will automatically activate the relevant agent based on context:

```bash
# UX/UI Agent activates
claude "Design a dashboard card for displaying blueprint stats"

# Debugging Agent activates
claude "Help me fix this CORS error"
```

### Method 2: Explicit Invocation
Mention the agent type directly:

```bash
claude "ux: Create a mobile nav menu"
claude "debug: Find why this component re-renders infinitely"
```

### Method 3: File-Based Context
When working in specific files, agents automatically understand context:

- Working in `components/ui/*.tsx` → UX/UI agent active
- Seeing error messages → Debugging agent active
- Editing forms → UX/UI agent considers accessibility
- API routes → Debugging agent watches for common mistakes

## 📚 Quick Reference

### UX/UI Agent

#### Common Requests
```bash
# Components
"Create a card component with glassmorphism"
"Design a button with loading state"
"Build a responsive navigation menu"

# Layouts
"Create a 3-column grid that collapses on mobile"
"Design a hero section with our brand styling"
"Build a dashboard layout"

# Styling
"Apply brand colors to this component"
"Add hover animations"
"Make this accessible"

# Forms
"Create a multi-step form wizard"
"Build a dynamic questionnaire"
"Design input validation states"
```

#### Key Principles
- **Glass First**: Use `.glass-card` for containers
- **Touch Friendly**: 44px+ minimum for interactive elements
- **Brand Colors**: Use CSS variables (`--primary-accent`, etc.)
- **Spacing**: Follow 4px grid (`space-4`, `space-6`, etc.)
- **Animations**: Keep under 300ms, use brand easing

### Debugging Agent

#### Common Requests
```bash
# React Issues
"debug: Component not re-rendering"
"debug: Getting 'Cannot read property' error"
"debug: Infinite loop in useEffect"

# TypeScript Issues
"debug: Type error in this component"
"debug: 'Property does not exist on type'"

# API Issues
"debug: Getting 401 unauthorized"
"debug: CORS error on fetch"
"debug: Supabase query failing"

# Build Issues
"debug: Next.js build failing"
"debug: Module not found"
"debug: TypeScript compilation error"
```

#### Debugging Workflow
1. **Gather Context**: Agent examines relevant files
2. **Generate Hypotheses**: Multiple possible causes
3. **Investigate**: Systematic testing
4. **Provide Solution**: Clear fix with code
5. **Prevent**: Guidance to avoid future issues

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Better UX/UI Results
1. **Be Specific About Context**: "Create a mobile-friendly pricing card" vs "Create a card"
2. **Mention Constraints**: "Design for mobile first" or "Must work on small screens"
3. **Reference Examples**: "Similar to the dashboard cards we have"
4. **Ask for Variants**: "Show me 2-3 design options"

### For Better Debugging
1. **Provide Error Messages**: Copy full stack traces
2. **Share Context**: What were you trying to do?
3. **Mention Recent Changes**: What did you modify?
4. **Test Suggestions**: Report back if fixes work

### For Both
1. **Iterate**: Start simple, refine with feedback
2. **Ask Questions**: Agents can clarify requirements
3. **Request Explanations**: "Why did you use X instead of Y?"
4. **Combine Agents**: "Debug this component and then improve its UX"

## 🔄 Agent Updates

Agents are living documents that evolve with your project:

- **Brand Updates**: When design system changes, agents stay in sync
- **New Patterns**: As you create new components, agents learn them
- **Best Practices**: Agents enforce current standards
- **Project Growth**: Agents scale with your codebase

To update an agent:
1. Edit the corresponding `.md` file in `.claude/agents/`
2. Add new patterns, remove deprecated ones
3. Claude Code automatically picks up changes

## 🎓 Learning from Agents

Agents don't just solve problems—they teach you:

- **UX/UI Agent**: Learn design system thinking, accessibility patterns
- **Debugging Agent**: Understand root causes, not just fixes
- **Both**: Reinforce project standards and best practices

Pay attention to:
- ✅ Code patterns agents use consistently
- 📚 Explanations agents provide
- 🛡️ Prevention guidance for future issues
- 🎯 Links to documentation and resources

## 📞 Getting Help

If an agent doesn't understand your request:

1. **Provide More Context**: Share relevant code or files
2. **Clarify Requirements**: Be more specific about what you want
3. **Ask for Alternatives**: "Show me other ways to do this"
4. **Reference Examples**: Point to existing components

Agents are designed to ask clarifying questions when needed!
